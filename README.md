It helps journalists, researchers, and digital forensics professionals quickly identify core information like **title, description, author, publication date**, and other useful details directly from the webpage.  

The project uses **Java** and **JSoup** for backend processing and a responsive **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend for interaction.
